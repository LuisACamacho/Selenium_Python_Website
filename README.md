# # The project aimed to conduct automation testing on the website https://www.python.org. In the testing, 5 test suits individually check if the five tabs on the website are accurately working and displaying the correct content of the pages. As well, I organized the coding structure by making four files. The test_main.py file contains the function calls organized to test the functionality and see if it has the expected result from the tests. The page.py file was created for the purpose of holding the functions that would interact with the User Interface. The functions acted to click the button or tab. Also, to check whether a piece of data is seen on the website. The locator.py file was used to store reusable selectors from the website. The element.py file was used to store and get the value when interacting with the website search bar. To add, I used the JSON library to store the data in a json file for the search results. I did use the HTML TestRunner library to incorporate test reports for the pass/fail tests for documentation purposes.
